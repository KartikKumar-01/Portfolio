                    <p>
                        I am Kartik Kumar, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, including Java, C++, C, Python, HTML, and JavaScript. My expertise spans across both back-end and front-end development, allowing me to work on complete projects, from conception to deployment.

                        With strong problem-solving skills honed through platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode, I am constantly improving my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am always eager to learn and embrace new challenges in the tech world.
                        
                        Beyond my technical expertise, I am deeply motivated to contribute to projects that have a positive impact on society. Through collaborative work in community-driven initiatives, I strive to make a difference both in technology and the world around me.
